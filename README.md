# markdown-previewer
 A little web app that renders a live preview of Markdown

## Learning log for this project
* Used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to set up project instead of [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
  * This is because create-react-app became cumbersome and clunky while working on the [random quote machine](https://github.com/Mfarabi619/random-quote-machine) project 
* Initial project setup with Vite:
  * Ran '$ npm create vite@latest'
  * Selected react template
  * Ran 'cd markdown-previewer'
  * Ran 'npm install'
  * Ran 'npm run dev'
* Learned Git console commands which sped up development
  * Was previously using GitHub Desktop to commit and push changes
  * Created a separate development branch in order to follow better practices
* Learned more Vim commands to speed up development
